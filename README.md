## Introduction
APIs play a crucial role in the real estate industry by facilitating data integration and data sharing between platforms in real time.
In this project I build a real estate application with Kotlin that consumes an API endpoint using retrofit that I created in this [repository](https://github.com/stackbilly/go-real-estate-api). The data obtained is then displayed in kotlin application using jetpack compose ui features.

## Tools
- [go-real-estate-api](https://github.com/stackbilly/go-real-estate-api) - A real estate api endpoint built with golang
- [coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil#jetpack-compose) - An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines
- [postman](https://www.postman.com/) - An API platform for building,testing and using APIs
- [retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.

## Usage
Clone this repository by running the following command
